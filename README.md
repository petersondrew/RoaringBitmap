# RoaringBitmap

A managed implementation of RoaringBitmap, intended to be API compatible with [Auralytical/CRoaring.Net][CRoaring.Net]

## Description

Mostly this is an exercise in bit-twiddling and exploration of [Roaring Bitmaps][RoaringBitmap] and the practicality (or lake thereof) of implementing them in a managed language like C#.  

This is an experiment and not production-ready, yada yada. I won't tell you what to do, but use at your own peril. You probably want to use [CRoaring][CRoaring] or one of its wrappers instead.
